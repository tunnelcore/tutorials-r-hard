# How to Set Up Miniconda on Ubuntu (Installed via Deskify on Your Android Tablet)

So, you've got this badass Ubuntu thing going on your tablet. Good shit. Now let‚Äôs set up Miniconda so you can actually *do* stuff. It‚Äôs gonna be awesome. Trust me.

## 1. **Update Your System**

Alright, first thing you gotta do, update your fukn system, bro. Don‚Äôt wanna be working with some outdated bullshit. Open that terminal and type this magic:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

This is like... cleaning your room before getting productive. You know? Gotta start fresh.

## 2. **Install Required Packages**

Alright, listen, you need some tools here, okay? Nothing fancy, just basic sh*t like `wget` and `bzip2`. So just... *fukn* install them with this:

```bash
sudo apt install wget bzip2
```

Easy peasy. Just let it do its thing. Don‚Äôt overthink it.

## 3. **Download Miniconda**

Now, okay, we‚Äôre getting somewhere. Time to download Miniconda. It‚Äôs like the foundation for all the cool shit we‚Äôre gonna do. If you're on a 64-bit system, grab the script with:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Wait... wait for it. Don‚Äôt get impatient.

## 4. **Run the Installer**

Okay, now, we‚Äôre in the *zone.* Time to install this bad boy. Don‚Äôt freak out, just run this:

```bash
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Follow the prompts. I mean, it‚Äôs not rocket science. Just hit ‚Äúyes‚Äù to whatever looks like a good idea, alright? 

## 5. **Initialize Conda**

Okay, now we‚Äôre really getting shit done. You need to tell your shell that Conda exists, so it can do the magic. Run:

```bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init
```

Restart your terminal or just type:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

At this point, you might feel like a hacker, and that‚Äôs good. Own it.

## 6. **Create a Conda Environment**

Alright, here we go. Time to *make* an environment. Like, this is where your Python magic happens. We‚Äôre going with Python 3.10 because... why not, right?

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.10
```

Then, fukn *activate* it:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

BOOM. You‚Äôre in. Now you‚Äôve got this whole environment dedicated to... whatever the fuk you want to code. You‚Äôre unstoppable now.

## 7. **Install Necessary Packages**

Alright, focus up, 'cause now we‚Äôre getting to the important part: installing the packages you need. Like, I dunno, **numpy** and **pandas**‚Äîeverybody uses that shit. So let‚Äôs install it:

```bash
conda install numpy pandas
```

Okay, okay, *woah*. Look at you go. You're basically running a whole fukn data science lab on your tablet now. Congrats, buddy.

## And That‚Äôs It! üéâ

Dude, you're done. You‚Äôve got this fukn beautiful Miniconda setup, and now you can get down to some serious Python stuff. Or take a break. You deserve it. But seriously, good job, bro. You *crushed* it.
